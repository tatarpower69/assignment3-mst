* Course: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
* Student: Ilnur Saipiyev

This project implements and compares **Prim‚Äôs** and **Kruskal‚Äôs** algorithms for finding the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a graph.  
The goal is to evaluate their **performance, efficiency, and practical differences** on graphs of various sizes (small, medium, large).

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Algorithm Results

Below is a summary of algorithm performance for all test datasets.  
Each graph was processed using **both Prim‚Äôs and Kruskal‚Äôs algorithms**, and the resulting MST total cost, execution time, and operation count were recorded

| ---------- | -------- | ----- | --------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Small)  | 5        | 7     | 16              | 16                 | 1.52           | 1.28              | 42       | 37          |
| 2 (Small)  | 6        | 7     | 18              | 18                 | 1.60           | 1.22              | 40       | 35          |
| 1 (Medium) | 8        | 10    | 33              | 33                 | 1.95           | 1.70              | 85       | 97          |
| 2 (Medium) | 9        | 11    | 47              | 47                 | 2.15           | 1.80              | 102      | 115         |
| 1 (Large)  | 15       | 14    | 85              | 85                 | 3.10           | 3.35              | 158      | 184         |
| 2 (Large)  | 16       | 15    | 102             | 102                | 3.40           | 3.75              | 174      | 191         |

   **Observations:**
- MST total cost is identical for both algorithms (correctness verified).
- Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm performs slightly faster on small/medium graphs.
- Prim‚Äôs algorithm scales more consistently with increasing graph size.
- Operation count increases roughly linearly with the number of edges, as expected.

## üß≠ Conclusion

Both **Prim‚Äôs** and **Kruskal‚Äôs** algorithms correctly produced the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for every tested graph, confirming that both implementations are accurate and reliable. However, their performance and efficiency varied depending on the graph‚Äôs size and density.

During testing, **Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm** performed slightly faster on **small and sparse graphs**, thanks to efficient edge sorting and simple Union‚ÄìFind operations. In contrast, **Prim‚Äôs algorithm** showed **more stable and predictable performance** as graph size and density increased, due to its adjacency-based design and use of a priority queue.

---

### üü¢ Prim‚Äôs Algorithm
- Performs more consistently as graph size increases
- Preferred for **dense graphs** represented via adjacency lists
- Offers **predictable runtime** ‚Äî ideal for large, well-connected networks

### üîµ Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm
- Usually faster on **small or sparse graphs**, where edge sorting is inexpensive
- Simpler to implement using **Disjoint Set Union (Union‚ÄìFind)**
- Performance may degrade with **edge-heavy (dense)** graphs due to sorting overhead

---

### ‚úÖ In Summary
- **Use Prim‚Äôs algorithm** ‚Üí for **dense and large graphs**
- **Use Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm** ‚Üí for **small or sparse graphs**
